  <h2>About New York City</h2>
  <p>
    New York City is one of the most iconic cities in the world. It's made up of five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and Staten Island.<br>
    The city is famous for its towering skyscrapers like the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, and Central Park — a massive green oasis in the middle of the urban jungle.<br>
    NYC is also the most linguistically diverse city on Earth, with over 800 languages spoken.<br>
    It's a global hub for finance, fashion, art, and entertainment, and it truly never sleeps.

  <h2>My Experience</h2>
  <p>
    Experiencing New York City up close made "America" feel very different and real to me.<br>
    I visited the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Central Park, and other places unique to America.<br>
    I took the subway and explored locations where blockbuster movies were filmed.<br>
    I tried different kinds of food, met people from various countries, and had the time of my life.<br>
    I traveled with my mom, my sister, and my brother on this trip, and I really enjoyed spending time with them.
